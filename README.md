# Sevria app

Before starting local development, make sure the API and database are up and running.
You can follow the setup guide at [sevria/docker](https://github.com/sevria/docker) to get them started.

## Getting started

```shell
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
